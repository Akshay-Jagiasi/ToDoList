# ToDoList


In this project, I gained a deeper understanding of how to implement EJS, a JavaScript templating language, in my web app.
I also learned more about connecting my app to a MongoDB database using Mongoose, and how to effectively utilize the database to perform various operations.
Through this project, I became more proficient in using these technologies to build dynamic, data-driven web applications with JavaScript.
